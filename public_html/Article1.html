         </p> <br>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Pylint allows you to do proper testing for your python programs as well as make sure that your programs are in line with modern PEP8 convention, meaning that you use clean and understandable syntax!</p></li>
         <li>Its best to install and use this package using docker to make sure theres no errors across different systems and platforms.</li>
         <li>In your Requirements.txt make sure to include the following to install the necessary things to lint, cover, and test your files</li>
         <img src="images/requirements.png" alt="requirements image"/>
         <li>In your Dockerfile make sure to include this command to install the required files for pylint</li>
         <img src="images/dockerProj2.png" alt="dockerCommands image"/>
         <li>Use this command to run your pylint to check your code: "pylint --pytest --cov"</li>
         <li>the flag --cov can be used to see how much of your code the tests and pylint check</li>
         <li>If there are things that you dont want to check, you can use this style of comment in order to make sure that its skipped in the pylint process.</li>

         <li> Here is a Glossary For all important OOP Terms used in the calculator program:</li>
         <table>
           <tr><td>Term/Design Patt.</td> <td>Definition</td>   <td>Example</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Factory</td>        <td>An object used to create other objects.</td>   <td>The Calculator class in calc2.1/calc/calculator.py is a Factory because it creates new operation classes when its called (Addition, Subtraction, Division, and Multiplication Classes)</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Instantiation</td>  <td>The realization/creation of an object instance.</td>   <td>A simple statement like "x = 1.5" is an instantiation because it takes a float object and assigns it a name (x) and a value (1.5)</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Object</td>         <td>An encapsulation of data and procedures to manipulate the data</td>   <td>A creation of a calculation from calc2.1/calculations/calculation.py is an object of the calculation class</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Class</td>          <td>A blueprint for creating objects</td>   <td>calculation in calc2.1/calculations/calculation.py is a class. It is used to create Calculation objects</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Namespace</td>      <td>A way to specify which library is being used in case there are conflicting library terms</td>   <td>While this isnt common in python, namespaces in C++ are used with common libraries like std in order to easily and neatly access the namespaces methods and classes</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Constructor</td>    <td>A method used to create an object</td>   <td>The "__init__" method in calc2.1/calculations/calculation.py is a constructor because it is whats executed when the class is called to make a new object</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Fixture</td>        <td>In testing: it is a way to prep the environment for testing</td>   <td>in calc2.1/tests/calculations_history_test.py the method clear_history_fixture clears the history of the calculator to make sure that the results of a test wont be ruined by any previous calculations</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Type Hint</td>      <td>In implicit typed languages like PHP and Python, type hinting is a way of explicitly casting a variable</td>   <td> In calc2.1/calculations/calculation.py on line 5, the parameter "values: tuple" creates a variable "values" but also demands that the variable be a tuple object</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Type Cast</td>      <td>Used to convert or declare a variable as a very specific type</td>   <td>while type casting varies based on types and language, an example in python would be "x = int(y)" where y could be a decimal like 5.0 or a string like "5" but because of the int statement surrounding it, it is converted directly to an integer</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Unit Test</td>      <td>A way of testing methods and classes</td>   <td>The tests in calc2.1/tests/division_test.py use unit tests to try specific cases and ensure that even if there an error there will be no breaks in the program</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Static</td>         <td>Anything that is static is accessible anywhere and has a lifetime of the entire program</td>   <td> the "convert_args_to_list_float" method in calc2.1/calculations/calculation.py is a static method meaning that it can always be accesed at any point in the programs</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Class Method</td>   <td>A method that exists solely within another class</td>   <td> in calc2.1/calculations/addition.py, the "get_result" method is a class method that is only usable thorugh that class or an instance of that class</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Facade</td>         <td>An encapsulation of multiple other classes, variables, and methods</td>   <td>The calculator class acts as a facade for all of the other classes and its encapsulated methods and objects</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Method</td>         <td>A series of operations and actions used to manipulate and create data</td>   <td>the methods within calc2.1/tests/addition_test.py are just methods that arent class methods because they can be called without needing a class instantiation and perform a series of operations and actions</td> </tr>
           <tr>   <td>Property</td>       <td>A variable characteristic of a class</td>   <td>In calc2.1/calculations/calculation.py, the values attribute is a property of the Calculation class because it is a variable in that class.</td> </tr>
